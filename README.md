# Advent-of-Code
This repository contains my solutions to multiple years of **Advent of Code**, implemented in C++.  
Each year has its own directory containing all daily solutions, inputs, and compiled outputs.

## 📁 Repository Structure
```cli
.
├── 2024/
│ ├── day01/
│ │ ├── day01a.cpp

```

### 🔹 Folders

- `YYYY/`  
  One folder per year (e.g., `2024`, `2023`).

- `YYYY/dayXX/`  
  Contains C++ solutions for that day:
  - `dayXXa.cpp` → Part 1  
  - `dayXXb.cpp` → Part 2

- `YYYY/input/`  
  Contains input files for that year (e.g., `day01.txt`).

- `YYYY/output/`  
  Compiled executables generated by `make`.

- `Makefile`  
  Builds a specific year/day/part solution.

## 🛠 How to Compile and Run

### ✔ Compile a Solution

From the repository root:

```console
make year=YYYY day=XX part=a|b
```

- **YYYY** → year (e.g., 2024)

- **XX** → day number with two digits (01–25)

- **part** → a or b


### Example
```console
make year=2024 day=17 part=b
```
This compiles `2024/day17/day17b.cpp` and stores the executable in: `2024/output/day17_partb`.

### ▶ Run a Solution
```console
./YYYY/output/dayXX_partY YYYY/input/dayXX.txt
```

### Example
```console
./2024/output/day17_partb 2024/input/day17.txt
```

## 🧹 Clean Build Files

To delete executables for a specific year:
```console
make clean year=YYYY
```

Example:
```console
make clean year=2024
```

## 📎 Notes
- Each year is self-contained.

- The Makefile handles parameterized builds, so no changes are needed when adding new years.
